# Google Chrome share web intents

I played a bit with [Web Intents](http://webintents.org).
Chrome.

[Web Intents in Chrome](http://www.chromium.org/developers/web-intents-in-chrome)
needs an extension to register a service.

There already exists a number of
[share intents in Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/collection/webintent_apps?_wi=http://webintents.org/share&_mt=text/uri-list)
but I missed [share intents](http://webintents.org/share) for
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) and for
[Yammer](https://www.yammer.com). So here they are.

They might be a bit rough around the edges.

Web Intents was [removed from Chrome version 24](https://plus.google.com/116171619992010691739/posts/gcXURKLN8bg) so this code is of no use any more.
